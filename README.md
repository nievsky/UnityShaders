# UnityShaders
> [!NOTE]
> * In this repository I store shaders I wrote in Unity or shaders I found in the internet
> 
> * These shaders stored in `.shadergraph` format, so you can easily import them to Unity
>
> * Each shader has parameters that can be modified to suit a specific case
>
> * In Unity you need to apply `.shadergraph` to material and this material apply to object to see shader
>
> * Some shaders depend on light in scene (Lit) and some shaders not (Unlit). There are shaders that can be applied to your render pass in render pipeline as a render feature (Fullscreen shaders)
>
> * Some shaders require subgraphs, you can find them in `/Bubgraphs` directory

## Lit Shaders
### Alpha Threshold
![Movie018](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f34823bf-33f2-43e5-a5cb-6b4a4bc81f20)

Can be useful, if you have sprite with background that should be transparent
 
---
### Dissolve Shader
![Movie012](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c25abb4-0050-4841-a045-ee3e1011e2b6)

The most recognizable shader. For this shader I created 2 scripts: 

* <b>DissolveAnimation.cs</b> - When you apply `DissolveAnimation.cs` to an object it allows to control animations for dissolve: appear, disappear, ping-pong. You can also adjust speed and padding in case your object doesn't appear/disppear fully
* <b>DissolveEditor.cs</b> - add buttons to Editor. Just import it in your project

### Cel Shader

---
### Dithering Shader
![Movie013](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95aeb953-59c5-4814-9d2a-f3f6646ea307)

When you decrease transparency, appears dithering

---

### Silhouette Shader
![Movie016](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ec8144d-7b45-47df-a072-d6d8b585479e)

It can be useful as a mask that only shows objects when you look through it

---
### Halftone Shader
![Movie024](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f38d41-1dcb-41b8-84f2-ea49f5aa3a58)

Shader that simulates a dithering effect for shadows

---
### Wave Vertex Shader (with foam)
![Movie020](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/456287b4-6196-475b-b6b3-e71a8a2449cd)

Vertex shader. You can apply a texture to make foams

---
### Dot Matrix Shader
![Movie017](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e634b37f-0c7c-4bfe-9de8-e34460c679b3)

---
### Intersection Occlusion (Ambient Occlusion)
![Movie026](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/046d99be-9683-47c1-ac99-f9cf0d8fc35f)

Creates shadow at the boundaries of intersection

---
### Glowing Intersection
![Movie032](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f064fec1-b227-48a5-8cbd-20d3ef2b8416)

Creates glowing at the boundaries of intersection, but depends on object's UV

---

## Unlit Shaders
### Fresnel Shader
![Movie014](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19c9cf95-6b91-43f4-81bc-8d49002db847)

Cool and versatile effect that can be used everywhere

---

### Balatro background Shader
![Movie022](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c79b6078-88d5-4ccb-b625-0e8fe9cd4c17)

Inspired by balatro background. To make shader more explicit you should apply a texture in editor (e.g. gradient)

---

### Portal Shader
![Movie023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/272bf830-745d-4a75-873b-4171ff4f1d2a)

Apply a texture in editor

---


## Fullscreen Shaders 
>[!WARNING]
> These shaders can only be applied into your render pipeline (URP, HDRP)
>
> Find your renderer (by default it's `PC_Renderer`)
>
> Add renderer feature -> Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature -> Add a metarial into `Pass Material`

### Grey scale Shader
![Movie033](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeccc9c7-7489-41ba-803d-ef83ccfecb3c)

Well, it makes the image grey...

---

### Outline Shader
![Movie034](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829633de-29dc-42ae-9b8a-3f4ac688f4ec)

Outlines objects 

---

### Outline + Halftone (mix)
![Movie036](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa5a6a8-4977-4454-b213-82ae4b07849a)

Halftone applied to objects, outline applied to render pass

---

### Dithering
![Movie038](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92447289-595b-4aa3-b5c7-b2571539cb50)


---

### Dithering 1-bit
![Movie037](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699324d0-ab30-4036-939b-2b4c18431d5f)


### Obra-Dinn dithering
    * To be added

### Blackhole shader (aka Outer Wilds)
    Currently working on the URP version using only ShaderGraph nodes
    Can be easily implemented using custom function to calculate sphere raycast
    Basically, displays the background on the sphere's UV with some distortion strength. So it depends on sphere's UV and amount of polygons. Recommend to use sphere with at least >10.000 polygons and flipped normals. Also make sure to render opaque textures first in your render settings (e.g. PC_Render)

### Skybox shader (procedural)
    * To be updated

---

## TOBEFIXED shaders
    1. Outline per object shader
    2. Blackhole shader can be updated to emulate outer wilds blackhole effects (such as mirroring)

## TOBEADDED
    1. .unitypackage file format to import all shaders
    2. material instance for each shader
    3. proper README
